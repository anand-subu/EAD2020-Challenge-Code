# EAD2020-Challenge-Code
Code for our EAD2020 Challenge Attempt (https://ead2020.grand-challenge.org/)

This repo will host the code for our solution of the EAD-2020 challenge as described in our [paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2595/endoCV2020_paper_id_22.pdf).

The main code resources hosted here, will be primarily the object tracking pipeline, the final segmentation  ensemble ,and the data generator used while training the semantic segmentation network.


# Resources:

The following resources were of great assistance to us while developing our object tracking pipeline, and our ensemble pipelines, in terms of both motivation and for reusing parts of code from, while building this solution, for which we would like to express our sincere gratitude.

### Object tracking pipeline:
